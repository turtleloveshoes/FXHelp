## ** Contributor guidelines **
-----------------

### Swift style
* Swift code should generally follow the conventions listed at https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide.
  * Exception: we use 4-space indentation instead of 2.

### Whitespace
* New code should not contain any trailing whitespace.
* We recommend enabling both the "Automatically trim trailing whitespace" and "Including whitespace-only lines" preferences in Xcode (under Text Editing).
* <code>git rebase --whitespace=fix</code> can also be used to remove whitespace from your commits before issuing a pull request.

### Commits
* Each commit should have a single clear purpose. If a commit contains multiple unrelated changes, those changes should be split into separate commits.
* If a commit requires another commit to build properly, those commits should be squashed.
* Follow-up commits for any review comments should be squashed. Do not include "Fixed PR comments", merge commits, or other "temporary" commits in pull requests.
